Repository for Go projects

## Source
The basics and examples are taken from the [Go Tour](https://tour.golang.org/list)

The [Go Documentation](https://golang.org/doc/) is also useful

More resources can be found at the end of the tour, [here](https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/11)

## How to run

You run a Go file like this:
```
go run FILEPATH
```

## How to use local packages

Inside the directory, run: 
```
go mod init MOD_NAME
```

Then you have to build the package: 
```
go build
```
